# Textutils Web-App

This is a basic text-utility app that helps a user to do some basic operations on his/her text, such as converting all text to Upper/Lower case, removing extra spaces, and viewing the number of words and characters.
I hope this application will bring in some convenince for everyone ðŸ˜ƒ .

# Resources I followed to build this

I give full credit to the Youtube channel of CodeWithHarry, as this app was made by me while following his React-js course. Building this project helped me learn many concepts of React js such as the file structure, JSX, Props and Proptypes, State and Handling events, and React router. <br>
